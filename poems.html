<h1> Inside the Mind of Sabrina Cossati</h1>   

<p> Now don't get scared. This tab is not gonna be full of urges to smell your feet and food (although that wouldn't be an inaccurate representation of my mind). You know ms girl is a yapper. I mean, why else would I be a journalism major? In this tab are some kind words that I have for you. Things that I think about when thinking of you, things that may remind me of you, etc. Basically, this is going to be the sappy dappy cute part of this website. BORING! Let's get into it. Just so you know, these are going to be completely random thoughts that come to my mind. They will not make sense reading them straight through, so don't try to make sense out of it.

<p> Osvando Lopez, you have helped me so much. You know ovbiously that when we first met, I was.. not in the greatest state. Am I 100% healed from everything? (This is the part where you turn to me and answer) I would assume that you said no. If you said yes, I'm flattered, but lying is not cool. I digress. Although I am not 100% there, I have made ALOT of progress, and you helped me so much with that. You have been there for me every step of the way. Through all of my ups and downs, and I am really grateful for that. </p>

<p>Relationships are funny. While getting to know you, I have also been getting to know myself, which is crazy to say because you would think that I would know myself a lot, but turns out that that is far from the truth. I have learned that there is a lot of me that is not the prettiest, and I do not mean physically, but emotionally, behaviorally, etc. I am an angry person. I have bad communication skills. I tend to shut down when I am upset instead of talking things out. Now, this isn't bash on Sabrina time, but you get my point. I say all of that to say that I did not realize all of this about myself until being with you. When in a healthy relationship you want to be better for the person, but also ovbiously yourself, and you helped me come to terms with that. I didn't only find out bad things about myself though, there have been many good things. You have introduced me to many different foods that I never thought I would try, shows, artists, etc. I was not the most open to trying new things until getting with you. You have really changed that about me, and I am super grateful. I love trying new things now, and expanding my horizons. Discovering these good and bad things about myself has helped me grow a lot as a person, which is what I love about you so much. You truly have helped me grow a lot and discover things about myself that I just never thought I would. I hope I have done the same for you. We are just two young adults learning and growing together in this very very interesting and confusing world, and I think that that is beautiful.

        <p>Before we met, I feel like I did not feel so comfortable to be myself like I am now. Like, I am a weird bitch, and I used to be ashamed of it. I would be so worried about what people think, and was so closed off. I still care about what people think a little bit, but it is not as bad as it used to be. You helped me learn to love me, and love being me. </p>

        <p> You should know this by now, but you truly are my best friend. My bestie. My pookie wookie dookie schmookie. You are who I am most vulerable with. Who I share every little thing with (even if you do not want to sometimes, example my farts). I have never been so open and vulnerable with someone before, and I just love it so much. I do not get scared to share my feelings with you. If you are annoying the shit out of me, I tell you :), and vice versa. We love annoying each other. It's why we work.  </p>

I love being in your arms. Looking in your eyes. I feel so safe. I do not feel safe around a lot of people, especially men, after everything I have been through. But around you I genuinely feel safe. 
</p>

<body> 
        <p> I  really do not know how else to describe it, but I am in love with you. You are my person. I want to share and experience everything with you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I love you so so so much. Thank you for being in my life. <3</p>
