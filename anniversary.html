<h1> Osvando and Sabrina's Two-Year Anniversary Special!</h1>   

<p> 
        Why hello, Osvando Lopez. This is Sabrina Cossati, your lover. You may be asking yourself, "Sabrina, why am I reading a message from you on a website" 
        (at least I hope that is what you are asking, because that would insinuate that I actually was able to make a website 
    on my own). To that question, I say "Why not? It would be cute". Do you agree? (this is the part where you turn to me and you tell me yes or no). I am just gonna assume that you said yes. Now, let's go on with the fun. </p> </body>
<body> 
    <p> We have a lot of cute things ahead of us today. Now, I could tell you, but that would spoil everything, so you will just have to see for yourself. I will give you a hint: It is regarding us. Who would've thought? </p> </body>
<body> 
   <p>Anyway, get ready for the ride. I added a playlist for you to listen to while we go through these tabs together. It will really set the mood. Have fun!</p>  </body>

<body>
   <p>Warning: There is going to be a lot of reading. Don't be a lazy nancy.
