<h1> Coupon Book</h1>   

<p> 
Now EVERYONE loves couponing (at least we should, because it gives you discounts and free things). The oppurtunity to get free things?? In THIS ECONOMY?? Sign me up. 

</p>

<p> I'm not the richest when it comes to money, but I am a billionaire when it comes to love hugs and snuggles, and I am willing to provide. </p>

<p> This tab is your own personal coupon book. There is a different assortment of coupons that you can redeem. What is so great about this book is that none of the coupons expire, and you can use them as much as you want! Isn't this the greatest deal you've ever seen?  </p>

<p> Here are the coupons you are eligible for: </p>

<p> To use these coupons, you have to print them out, and when you want to use them simply present them to me, and they will be in effect.</p>

<p> Now I know what you are thinking: "I don't have a printer, and I do not feel like printing them out." First of all, LAZY. Second, I already printed them out for you. </p>

<p> I know, I'm amazing. </p>

<p> I already know you are waiting to use the scratches coupon, so I am not going to waste any more time. I hope you enjoy your new coupons <3</p>
